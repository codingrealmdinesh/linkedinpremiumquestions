A lot of my spare time lately has been dedicated to teaching myself how to shoot and edit instructional videos.

 

I've been a garage-sale shopper for several years, and I sell my finds on eBay to pay down my student loan debt. So far I've raised $11,000. People who find out that I do this often have a lot of questions about how to get started, how to find the best stuff, and how to market items on eBay.

 

So I've decided to put a few tutorials up on YouTube. That way people can learn through the videos—and I gain a new creative skill.

I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I’ve backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across Asia, South and Central America.

 

For our honeymoon, my wife and I travelled northern India for 6 weeks. It’s a very diverse region, home to Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists, and we really enjoyed spending time in a few different states.

 

We did a diverse set of activities like hiking the Himalayas and Ladakh, finding cool hot springs, and Vipassana meditation. Vipassan is a 10 days of silence meditation. I’ve really connected with the technique and have found it to be a powerful way to focus my attention and reset myself.

Outside of work, I enjoy fitness training, perfecting my golf swing, writing and recording music, and taking care of my dogs.

 

This year I will be releasing my 4th album, which is all-instrumental, featuring classical guitar. I play every instrument and record tracks at my home office. Currently, two are streaming on iTunes and Amazon Music. I’m working towards a completion goal of late July.

 

I find that music is a wonderful creative outlet and stress-reliever, as well as a perfect balance for my demanding career. It allows me to set personal goals and achieve them, which is also true of physical fitness. I’ve found that keeping my mind and body sharp improve every single facet of my life.

My wife and 5 children are my top priority. As a family, we stay very active and enjoy outdoor activities like camping and waterskiing.

 

I played collegiate soccer and when 3 of my children joined teams, I took up coaching. I became so involved that the city requested my help in building out their recreational soccer training program.

 

I also volunteer with a youth group through our church. I act as a mentor, helping young men set and achieve their own goals. For example, if they want to learn how to do an oil change, I empower them to learn. I’ll help them track down a car, guide them in the research, then oversee the process.

 

As a father and community member, these activities have been enormously rewarding. It’s nice to feel like I’m making a difference in people’s lives.

 

Why this answer worked well:

The candidate’s commitment to family, community, and volunteerism shows follow-through.
The answer paints a picture of a productive and dependable team player.
